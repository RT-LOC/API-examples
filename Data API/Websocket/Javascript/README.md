# Websocket connection

Our desktop software can open up a websocket server.
This demo code sets up a websocket client in the browser which connects to the server, and prints out received messages.

## Getting started

* Make sure the server details are correct (host/port)
* Open *index.html* in a modern browser (e.g. Chrome)
* Open up the developer console (`Ctrl+Shift+I`), incoming messages will be printed out here
