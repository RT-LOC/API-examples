# Python REST API

This demo script connects to the API (using [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)), logs in (using our demo user), get the projects metadata and print them on screen.

## Dependencies

* Python 3 (Specifically 3.7.2, but should work in other versions too)
* [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)

## Getting started
* (No setup prerequisites, this demo will connect with our broker)
  
* Install the libraries with:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* And then run the script:
```
python3 get_projects.txt
```
