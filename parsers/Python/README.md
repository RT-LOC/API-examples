# Usage
Make sure the program `cxRTLS` is running on the server. This can be on the same machine as this PC.
```
python3 tcp_client.py *ip_address_of_server*
```

# Remarks
 - This demo will only work with Python 3.4+, because of the *asyncio* tcp client. But the decoder/parser should be compatible with **Python 2.7+**!
 - Feel free to change this code however you want. Improvements are welcome and can be sent via Pull Requests.
