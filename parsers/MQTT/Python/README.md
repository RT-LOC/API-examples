# MQTT client demo

This demo code connects to the RTLOC MQTT broker (using a paho-mqtt client), subscribes to a few topics, and prints the output. (using our demo user, and always-on demo MQTT data)

## Getting started

* `pip install paho-mqtt`
* Run `python client.py`

> Depending on your python installation and your OS, you might run slightly different commands, e.g. `pip3` & `python3`
